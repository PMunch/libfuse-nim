# LibFUSE experimentation in Nim

Just creating this repository to share my experimentation with
[LibFUSE](https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse) in Nim. In `hello.nim` I've
implemented the `hello.c` "filesystem" to check that everything worked as
expected. And it should be rather easy to create more complex filesystems with
this. If I end up creating more ergonomic high-level wrappers around libfuse
then I'll likely convert this into a proper Nimble package.

For now you can compile this by installing libfuse3 (if you don't already have
it) along with Nim and Futhark, then run `nim c hello` to compile and
`./hello <path to empty folder>` to create the filesystem. You can also use
`--help` to get the options for the program, along with FUSE options.

Things implemented:
- `hello.nim` simple filesystem which mounts a single folder with a single file
  the content of which can be controlled with options on startup.
- `jsonfile.nim` takes a JSON object as a string as an option and mounts one
  file per key, and a directory for each object and array. Keys can be written,
  and on unmount the final object is written out.
